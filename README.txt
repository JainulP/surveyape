Surveyape provides a platform for users to create and take survey. The user is offered a myriad of options to create questions for the survey. The surveyors are invited to take the survey either through email or QRcode. The Surveyor can see the statistics for each survey and will be analyze the results. We have options for user to take the survey anonymously as well. We have used the best UI/UX design to make it easy for the surveyors and surveyee to create and take the survey respectively. A user can sign up for suveyape account and he would be sent a confirmation mail to activate his account. The application was developed using Spring boot for the backend, JPA with Hibernate as the provider for persistence, MySQL for the database and ReactJS for the frontend.
